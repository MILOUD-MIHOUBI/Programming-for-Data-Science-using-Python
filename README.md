### Submission of this project

In this project, the candidate would just have to utilize Python as programming language to investigate data linked to bike share schemes in 3 main cities in america: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The candidate would just have to develop code to (a) ingest the dataset and solve intriguing questions about somebody computing statistical analysis, and (b) write a piece which utilizes inputted data to create a dynamic interaction in the console to show those statistical data.

### Description
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The main three files used for excuting the program are defined as follow : 

** --> new_york_city.csv
** --> washington.csv
** --> chicago.csv

### Credits
The Project Submission entailed printing out a document with most of the Git commands necessary to complete the task given.
